Your task is to build a web application that allows users to review their past sales calls. 

The application should enable users to view a list of their previous calls, as well as ask questions about any specific call and receive answers based on the call's transcript. 

Users might want to ask things like: "What’s the buyer's main pain point?" or "What next steps were agreed upon?".

### Guidelines
You're provided with a calls.json file, which contains metadata and transcripts for 5 sample sales calls.
Use Anthropic's API to generate answers to user questions.
You’re provided with an API key in anthropic-api-key.txt
Please use the Claude 3.5 Haiku model exclusively to minimize inference costs.
You are allowed to use AI tools / code editors to assist in development, but please document how AI assistance was used.
Feel free to use any web framework or libraries of your choice.

### Submission
Deploy the app to a cloud platform of your choice (e.g., AWS, GCP) and share the live URL along with the source code and instructions for running the app locally. We’ll reimburse any deployment costs.
