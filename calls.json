      "text": "<01:08> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nHey Felix.\n\n<01:10> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nHi, Dan. How are you?\n\n<01:11> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nHow you doing? I'm doing well, how are?\n\n<01:14> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nVery, very well. Yeah, I mean it's literally the last call before the weekend now and it was my birthday. Oh, okay.\n\n<01:23> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nHappy birthday. Thank you.\n\n<01:25> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nI have quite a nice weekend planned out. Intense but nice. So yeah, excellent.\n\n<01:32> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nThat sounds great. We'll end on a good note then for the week and let you get back to it. Yeah, that's great. Well, happy birthday again and maybe we can just basically today pick a topic, sort of call and sort of figure that stuff out. Is that what the goal is here?\n\n<01:49> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nYes, I would say topic plus timeline. I think that will also just be great to align on. I mean you have there more intel, as in when do we go public, what do we need, how much does the content need to be defined before we go public or is it more like the topic and then we can still hustle three days before to find a good yeah, just like your post experience there. Yeah.\n\n<02:16> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nSo the unfortunate answer to the second part of question there is that it kind of depends. Some people like to get it done a lot ahead of time and then some people sort of last minute change. It on me. I prefer to get it done ahead of time, but I understand, look, if we need to slightly shift topic at the last minute, it's not a problem. But I would suggest that if we can nail the topic, what I'd like to do is have at least a couple of weeks beforehand free to do some promo and to do some basic, I guess, planning for some emails and some LinkedIn posts. So what we could do is either keep the date that we have right now, which is I believe December 7, I think it was that first week of December, or we can push it to January and do it then sometime. I have a couple of spots open in January as well. So it's really up to you. When you feel ready.\n\n<03:07> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nWe are fine with 7 December we also have the capabilities to do everything before kind of the day we go live. For me it was just like more of a planning question, as in when do we have to basically free up the time? So we're all good? Yeah.\n\n<03:27> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nOkay. So what I would possibly do is if I could get you guys to once we choose a topic today, if I could get you guys to put together a brief blurb like a description of what's involved in the content, that would be helpful for me. So I don't put words in your mouth and at the same time while you're doing that, you can share the slides with me. You don't have to, it's not a problem. But the blurb is important. And then what I would do is I would prep a couple of emails to our list and then a couple of LinkedIn posts to Kyle's audience and we would tag Glyphic and do all that stuff. And if you're open to doing the same, that would be great to promote to your list as well and to also involve in LinkedIn.\n\n<04:05> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nYes, I mean, of course we are, for sure. And I can give you sorry. Yeah. For me, kind of one question about the topic and that's maybe my topic slash also set up is like how from your experience or what? Or like, should you plan with interactions really in the workshop? Are there interactive? Should we there plan some more tasks or questions to the task, maybe not, but questions to the audience, discussions in the audience? Or is it more like of a frontal presentation?\n\n<04:49> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nWe've done both types. I think the easier type to manage is the standard presentation with a little bit of Q and A at the end. So let's say a half an hour presentation. You can make it even shorter if you want to, but half an hour, I think a good length of a presentation plus like maybe 15 minutes, give or take, Q and A. And we've done it in the past where we've done like a workshop and we've also done the more kind of interrupt the speaker and ask questions now. And it's interactive, but to be totally honest, I think the more effective one is the presentation unless we have a very focused point. So if you're open to doing that, I think a 30 minutes presentation planned for roughly 15 minutes of Q and A. And I would be kind of in the background while you're doing the presentation, managing the chat and then collecting the questions. And then I would be the one, I would come in at the end of the presentation and say, hey, Felix, okay, we've got this question from Jim over here. He's saying blah, blah, blah. And I would just basically be reading out the things to you. Yeah.\n\n<05:45> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nSo I think Adam will be in the work we will be doing, but 100%, I think that's a good idea. I think from the topic, for me, it was a bit of a question. So, hey, thinking about the topic, how can we do something that is not like salesy, not a demo or we're not the ultimate quintessence of our product? So we would love to make it a bit more thought leadership style. I think that's also what we discussed in our first meeting and I think something around the notion of going through different sales tasks and different processes in the customer lifecycle and going through this then versus now versus future. So kind of alluding to how to use AI and how can we use technology essentially right now most efficiently. But also, and I think here, the expertise of Adam just being like a machine learning researcher comes in great where we can kind of be creative, in a sense, or also be visionary, in a sense. Like, how do we think this might actually look five years from now? How do we think about the role of, like, how does the sales cycle look five years ago? Will demo calls that happen five years from now will outbound sales that happen five years from now? And I think we can have like a past now, future kind of structure in that.\n\n<07:17> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nWell, I definitely like the look, at the very simplest level, let me put it this way. I think that many people would walk away kind of with their minds blown looking at how they currently take notes or they currently record, whether it's an actual recording of a demo call or whether they're taking notes literally right after the call. The current state like this right now, what you can do with something like Glyphic, you don't have to be salesy about it just by saying, this is how show the example, use the platform to show the example. And I think that by itself would be a very successful webinar, in my opinion. But if you can then take that and say, look, specifically because if we say sales process as a whole, it becomes a little bit more ground to cover. I think the more places that you try to jump in because you could mention them briefly say, look, this kind of thing with AI is going to apply to the sales process here, here, and here. But today, let's look specifically at how we're capturing the knowledge in a way that is usable, maybe post call, I think that's where my interest is. But if you have a different one, feel free. And then, as you said, past, current and then a little bit of future, I think would be great. So, yeah, I think that's good. But I would try to tighten up basically what's the one step of the sales process that Glyphic specifically is. You guys as a team, you guys on a mission, what are you trying to change about sales right now? And I think that makes a very good sort of focal point.\n\n<08:53> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nAnd I think that's kind of new from our side, like the saying. But I kind of think this don't sell, solve idea grade where you can basically you get people on the first call that's like a performance part, right? But I think the first two or three calls of like a sales process for three or four touch points until the first close of the contract. I think this mid funnel essentially is stuff that we really want to change and stuff where we see a huge potential not only for sales teams, like data potential not only for sales teams, but for product strategy and engineering teams. But the most benefits come through from our product is because we collect the data, we have to manage people through the funnel.\n\n<09:44> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nAnd yeah, I think that's kind of let me push you on that one a little bit because I think it's a great why do you want to change that? What's the current bad state? Describe that to me. AES a problem?\n\n<09:58> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nYeah, I think that's a great question and I think it's clear right now people try to I just talked to Persona, you don't have to mention them, but they're going to sell me shit that I don't even need. And I think that's not because they are aware that I don't need it. It's just because it's their process to give me that demo ABC and just offer me a freaking ATS even though I told them I don't hire for the next three months. Right. And this is kind of the stuff that it doesn't work. And I don't feel it's a problem of they just want to force it upon me, but just them not micro segmenting nicely enough their customer base and those kind of people actually need that. And let's solve that for them because I bet there are great angles how persona can be super helpful for us. But I think the people just try to pitch me a standardized form and I think this is kind of this don't sell but solve. Like think about we help you figure out and predict the problems of the people you're going to talk to and we're going to basically offer you the intelligence of trying to offer them exactly what they need.\n\n<11:09> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\n1 second here because that's great real problem.\n\n<11:12> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nAnd then also helps for product teams again because they understand what exactly which product and customer group needs. So they can do feature prioritization. You can might want to adjust your ICP you might want to adjust your marketing strategy based on that. And I think all that is like very data just trickles down into all departments and I think whereas back then it might be like a node in your salesforce but this note in your salesforce will never be picked up by a product guy or by strategy guys because it just lives in isolation. Fantastic.\n\n<11:47> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nGive me 1 second here. Better convo. And I heard basically three levels of improvement, which is very good here. So number one is like you said, don't sell solve. You find the underlying problem to focus on for the rest of the conversation that's very connected to that. You have the opportunity for better personalization and a better sales process in general, better experience for probably both sides. And then finally number three, you have the chance for overall learning that you can feed into back to your marketing team, back to your sales team, back to whatever. And I personally would add a fourth one that I think is a big thing that comes up as a pain point with the people who I speak to. I see a major problem with when a deal is passed along to people or if one person leaves the company and has their pipeline in a certain state. Some people have these great fantastic notes. Guess what? That's 1% of the people. For most other people it's a bunch of other things that they have to go through. Kind of figuring out how this person organized stuff. Reading through some crappy notes, there's a massive loss of knowledge transfer. Anyway. So I think that there's some really cool topics in there that maybe if you could build the presentation around either any one of those or any three, four of those, whatever, I think we have a chance for a really good thing. Because once you start talking in that language, I think it's really going to resonate with a bunch of people. So I think that the audience for this specifically by the way, is while we're talking to the startup founder and the decision maker. I think quietly, if you're making life a lot easier for the sales manager, sales executive leadership person, that's increasingly direction we're going as a company, we're more and more going towards VP of sales and all that stuff. But then also the mindset of oh, I can make this easier for my team and get results for the company versus the salesperson's mentality is like basically how do I get more wins for mean the sentence is not for me, but it also goes back to that also like why it's for founders relevant.\n\n<14:08> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nI think I was at some event where someone said like your ICP is a living organism and I really like that nice. I really like the idea of that sentence because it's dynamic and we help detect this Dynamism.\n\n<14:27> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nAgain, a huge thing in sales. As a copywriter, I will tell you that every few months one great subject line, one great angle suddenly gets copied by everybody starts to work, everybody copies it, it starts to die, something else comes in and replaces it. And being able to stay on top of the trends market wise, but also with your specific focus, hugely important. So yeah, I think you almost have a bunch of great bullet points here to talk through. I think there's some really good stuff. So look, I think the best next step for me would be if we go away, I'll let you sort of put together the final angle. But I think basically choose one of these as like an entry point and then cover all of them, but one of them probably stands out to you more than others.\n\n<15:16> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nWhat would be like the one that you feel, I mean, you know your crowd best. What would be like the headline that you want to where you would think this will attract most people to the webinar, the headline value proposition.\n\n<15:37> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nSo I would go something along the lines of how AI does blank whatever. Let's start with that. I think that's a good hook in general. And then what I would like to do is probably this is enough definitely it's not the headline, but something along lines of how AI can create a better sales experience and lead to more closed deals, something like that. But I think that for me, the personalization, the better experience, that's what speaks to me the most. But there's a lot also in there that you could make a very good argument for any one of them, including the one of just feeding back and being able to the living organism, one where you're staying on top of both your ICP, the market, et cetera, et cetera. So let me have a think about it and then I can email you a little bit later today. Just so you have it in email. Obviously I know your day is ending and you're have a birthday weekend. Let me give you a couple of options. Basically choose any one of those options. Send me back a blurb with a bunch of more detail that you would speak through and then I'm going to create the promo flow and we would start promoting probably about ten days a week beforehand.\n\n<16:58> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nSo basically next week, right? Mid end next week. Sounds amazing. Let's do it. We don't have to do that. I was mentioning like this opinion piece that we want to put out. We're going to do it either way. I'll just put it out whether it makes mean kyle hasn't reacted to it. I think if he's busy it's also completely I just thought it's a nice idea.\n\n<17:23> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nIt's a great idea.\n\n<17:24> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nWe don't have to do it right now. It's also fine.\n\n<17:26> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nIt's a great idea. Can you send me here's the things like we're doing a lot of internal work right now around messaging and around changing our offer and so there's a lot happening. So sorry if it got lost, but I think what I would make it easy from my side is if you guys could send me something that either needs to be is there a paragraph, is there more to it?\n\n<17:51> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nI haven't sent the thingy to you yet. Right, shit, I want to do that. Let me just do it right after I just sent you. Just quickly. Like the Google Docs, right? So basically it's like four points that we've elaborated on. There can be a fifth one if you are from a strategy very freely.\n\n<18:09> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nYeah, please.\n\n<18:12> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nI'm going to send it over after the call and you just let me know. No pressure, no stress.\n\n<18:18> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nNo, I definitely want to be involved and I would love to find an opportunity for you guys to guest post also on our blog and do some stuff because there's a good opportunity there with a lot of overlap and I know the team is very excited in general about Cliffic. So I think there's some really good and if you can steal this customer, he's a friend of ours who's an AI consultant. He's a heavy user of civil. And if you like I can introduce you to you also offered that in the email, right?\n\n<18:52> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nI forgot that.\n\n<18:52> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nYeah, I want to push that a little bit because he introduces a lot of companies to stibyl and it's good, but I don't think it's as good as so but feel free to I'll send you an intro letter today. And his name is Kevin. Great guy. And I'll think if there's any more people to sort of connect in the space too because I think you guys really have something cool to do. So any opportunities for the future for some work together, I think I would be very excited about it. I really believe in what you guys are doing. There's really only a handful of companies that I feel like this okay, so let's do that. I'll send a few options of headlines once I can just marinate on this a little bit, get the blurb back from you and then move forward with I'll wait for your email about the content and then I'll also send the intro email and move on from there. And if anything's lost, please email me. Sounds amazing.\n\n<19:45> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nSounds amazing. Great.\n\n<19:46> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nOkay. All set?\n\n<19:48> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nYes, 100%. Awesome. We're looking forward same.\n\n<19:51> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nHave a great weekend, enjoy the birthday belatedly and celebrate and all that stuff. And I'll be in person with you. I don't know, I'll give you a high five and have a drink.\n\n<19:59> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nI will for sure do that.\n\n<20:01> Buyer 0 (Dan McDermott):\nHave good take care.\n\n<20:04> Seller 1 (Felix Roesner):\nBye."

Well, it was a good game. Manchester United almost lost, but eventually managed to pull it on penalties. But Liverpool's doing well, at least. That's good.\n\n<00:17> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nYeah, I'm a happy man, you know?\n\n<00:19> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nGood, good, good. Well, thanks. Thanks again for taking the time to talk with me. My name is Devang. I'm a co founder at Glyphic. We're building the next generation of conversational intelligence for sales teams. And, yeah, in this call, I just love to understand a bit more about your sales process, and then we can decide if adding a layer of AI to your organization is the right fit for you. Does that sound good?\n\n<00:55> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nThat sounds fine. Like, I have a meeting in 15 minutes, so I don't know if that works for you in terms of time.\n\n<01:01> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nYeah, 15 minutes works. Works great for me. All right, great.\n\n<01:09> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nYeah, sounds very interesting to thank. So, I mean, let's just cut to the chase. Like, I'm. You've seen my LinkedIn profile. You know what we do. Yeah. I'm currently a CRO. Right. So I manage five teams around the world in total, 100 reps. So it's a very dynamic organization. We have very extensive tech, tech, tech stack as well. But, yeah, I mean, this introduction was made to me. They told, like, hey, you have to talk to glyfic. I haven't really looked into what you guys do, but, I mean, give it your best shot. Okay, awesome.\n\n<01:45> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nThat's great to hear that, people, that you got introduced into us, and we work with a lot of teams which have large distributed sales teams, and I think that's really one of the strengths of glyfig. So just before we dive in, right, like you mentioned, you have 100 reps, and I looked at your LinkedIn as well. Just very quickly, do you like how. What sort of tech stack are you using in your sales organization right now? Do you have any call recorder? Or, like, do you like, what sort of CRM are you using? And.\n\n<02:19> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nYeah, so currently we're Salesforce organization. We have extensive playbooks for our verticals. I believe that some of the teams are using, are testing some cool recorders, are using it to optimize their transcription of the actual sales conversations.\n\n<02:44> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nBut that's basically where we are right now.\n\n<02:47> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nI mean, I can ask the separate team leads, but this is what I know on my level, basically.\n\n<02:52> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nPerfect, perfect. Great. Yeah. So just before dive in. Like, just quick, quick intro to me. Like, before glyphic, I was at DeepMind. We were both me and Adam, we were AI researchers. We were really there at a very exciting time where we were inventing most of the core technology of llms and. But then we decided that our work there was like super exciting, but we wanted to apply it into a more applied product setting, which is why we set up glyphic to apply it within the sales domain and within the sales domain. It was just like when we spoke to sales leaders and we realized how under disrupted this space has been for the last ten years or so. We realize that we have to do something within sales where there is all of these very information rich conversations that are happening from which you can extract this key information on which GTM decisions can be made and sales teams can be transformed. But, yeah, enough about me. Just would love to understand. Like you mentioned, you have 100 reps. Do you have a rough idea of how many calls they're having per week?\n\n<04:16> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nI would say that average deal cycle right now is four weeks. So the reps are very high intensity of calling. There's a ballpark figure per ae. It should be 15 calls per week. I mean, it varies on the vertical, on the region, but that's to work with.\n\n<04:37> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nSo 15 calls per week per rep. So that means you are having 1500 conversations per week across your organizations. About 6000 a month. That's a lot of conversations, man. Yeah. And do you know roughly how your reps, like, like how much time the reps are spending around those calls? Like, do they prepare? Like, do they, how long do they spend preparing for the calls? And, like, after the call, how long might they spend in writing follow up emails or doing CRM entry?\n\n<05:12> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nThat's a very good question, actually. I don't know. I don't know if I'm also curious to learn what other CROs are doing in this position. Like, we've scaled very quickly as an organization. I mean, it's just part of the business, right? Like, I mean, you have to follow up and you have to prepare for a goal.\n\n<05:29> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nAbsolutely, absolutely. I mean, yeah, on Fido's growth has been really insane. Right? You guys went from ten to 100 reps in two years and that's just really like an amazing job there. Yeah, I think. Happy to give some color here. What we've seen is most organizations we're seeing reps are spending about 15 to 30 minutes preparing for the call. And that's everything from looking up information about the company, about the prospect, thinking about what was discussed on the last call, and kind of preparing for how to drive the deal forward. Does that sound about right to you?\n\n<06:07> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nYou can't ask me that because I just told you that I don't know.\n\n<06:11> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nOkay. Yeah, that's, that's, yeah. Fair.\n\n<06:14> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nOkay. I mean, that sounds pretty, that sounds, I mean, okay, this sounds pretty reasonable.\n\n<06:21> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nFair enough. And, yeah, and I think we're seeing people are spending about 30 minutes after each call, for, after each call doing activities like writing the follow up email, doing all the CRM entry, and updating all the notes on CRM, on Salesforce, etcetera. And, yeah. So basically about 1 hour per call is spent on doing the preparation. And the follow up is what we've seen across the companies we work with. Does that, is that, is that roughly, if you were to, do you think if you were to look into one of your reps a week that you would see something similar?\n\n<07:09> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nI mean, if you do the basic math, I mean, it sounds, yeah, there are 15 conversations per week. 15 hours. Like the actual conversation plus the prep, it's like 25 to 30 hours per week based on the actual sales motion and maybe the remaining ten to 15 hours on prospecting. So it doesn't sound too outrageous to me.\n\n<07:34> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nExactly. So what we've seen is that, yeah, exactly as you said. Right. People are spending close to 15 hours a week on these, on activities like this, preparing for the call and doing the follow up, which we now think, which with glyphic we can use AI to do automatically to a large extent and really cutting that time down from maybe an hour into ten minutes, giving you the time back so that your reps can focus on either prospecting or to generate more pipeline or be able to get through more prospects.\n\n<08:15> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nOkay. Yeah.\n\n<08:18> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nAnd just so one more, one more question to understand, like your position. Do you know, like, how are you tracking the quality of your sales conversations right now? Like, do you. Yeah, yeah.\n\n<08:36> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nSo of course we have a, we have a validation methodology in place. Right. So we use actually band to ensuring that the deals are in a proper way, moving to the pipeline.\n\n<08:50> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nGot it. And so you use band to make sure that the deal is of high quality and all the great. And do you feel that that methodology is applied consistently within your organization?\n\n<09:04> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nYou know? Right. Like, I mean, the team leads are pushing very hard to making sure that the reporting is in place. But yeah, she just said, I mean, we're doing six, we're doing 1500 calls per week. So I'm sure something slips through the cracks, you know?\n\n<09:24> Seller 0 (Devang Agrawal):\nAbsolutely. I think what we've seen with other organizations we work with is that managers try hard, but especially in very fast growing teams, they are also stretched, and they can't ensure that. They can't go in and listen to every call and or to ensure that your sales framework is applied consistently to all calls, which means that a lot of the deals within your pipeline are just. Are the ones that, which are never going to close because they've not been qualified correctly. But, yeah, so I think that's another place where everything that glyphic can be really, really helpful into your organization. And, yeah. So from what I've heard today, I think the most value we can add to your organization, it would be through also automating call preparation and call follow ups, which would save your reps many hours a week. And then on top of that, we will ensure that each of your deals in the pipeline is properly qualified with your sales framework, making sure that the time, that the time is going towards the most valuable opportunities. So if you're. So would you, would you love to. On the next call, I'd love to show you a simulation of what a day of a and their manager would look like with glyphic. If you. Do you have some time next week?\n\n<11:07> Buyer 1 (Theo Blake):\nOkay, so we're going to stop here, Dipang. Okay. But the important thing here, like. So I'll give you feedback on the rest of the conversation. Okay. But at the end, if I'm a croft,"

      "text": "<00:05> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nHello.\n\n<00:09> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nHow are you doing?\n\n<00:11> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nGood, how are you?\n\n<00:13> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah, not too bad, thank you. Can't complain. Can't complain. Nice. That's good. How are you guys?\n\n<00:23> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nI caught a bug, so I'm. I'm still recovering, but it's better than early in the week, no?\n\n<00:30> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nWell, hopefully you're on the good side of the bug. I feel like this year there's just always something going around. Was it you again chat that just decided to spread the germ the original time?\n\n<00:44> Seller 2 (Chatura Fernando):\nNo, it wasn't me this time.\n\n<00:47> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nAe. You sure?\n\n<00:50> Seller 2 (Chatura Fernando):\nWell, there's no evidence this time. I didn't come in away with it, if anything.\n\n<00:58> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nSounds good, sounds good, yeah, all good, thank you. Yeah, just been busy. I'm catching up post after being away, so that's always a fun task, trying to work out what on earth's been going on for the past week. But, yeah, no, back into the swing of things and, yeah, can't complain.\n\n<01:27> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nI hope glyphic can help with catching up at least. A.\n\n<01:31> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nAh, see what you've done there, Adam.\n\n<01:33> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nThere we go.\n\n<01:36> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nThat is true. It did help. It did. No, that was very handy. Just having a quick scan over the calls over the past week and seeing if there's anything that I need to sort of escalate or keep an eye on. So that was handy.\n\n<01:54> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nCool. Perfect. Yeah. With the check in, what we just wanted to kind of see is general feedback. How has it been going so far? And then we can also discuss maybe some of the features that we were discussing previously. One was around. I know you guys wanted keyword search for the product team and it's something that we're rolling out quite soon and then better stats on usage, which is something that we should be rolling out soon. AES. Well, cool in the admin dashboard. Yeah, nice.\n\n<02:27> Seller 2 (Chatura Fernando):\nAlso, there was one thing I spoke to Morgan as well, two weeks, a week ago, and he was talking about how the email generation wanted a bit of. A bit of improvement there and that's a little bit more early on, but we're thinking we might have some features there that will help him out. So hopefully that was ended.\n\n<02:44> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah, I did see that email from him. I do get it from his point of view in terms of maybe making it a little bit more AES, concise and sharp as possible, but I still think that maybe we shouldn't lean on that email generation follow up 100%. It should be almost like a framework that we can feed off and then he should make it his own email. But, yeah, I do get it. Maybe the bit more concise part of it, but no, I mean, it's good that he's looking into it. I think Morgan has probably been one of the guys that's the most engaged in the tool, which I probably would have put money on anyway, just because me and him are quite similar in the sense of the way how we sell. We like these kind of tools. We've used tools like this before, so it's kind of weird not having one, which is great. But I think, yeah, in terms of just the general feedback from. There was always going to be some people that don't engage with the tool. Not really a huge fan. It's typically normally the sales guys that probably maybe on the older side of the team that probably just quite happy just doing their own thing still. And then I think where we probably most likely find the benefit at the moment is in our regional account teams rather than our key accounts, just because the amount of calls are more frequent. So there's a lot more information to hold up. There's a lot more different accounts, a lot more different variety of usages, et cetera, et cetera. So that's where I think the team are finding it quite powerful and, yeah, so I've had two feedbacks from the two out of three feedbacks from the sales directors and I think they do find it useful. I don't think there's like a direct link they see a direct link to, like, if we bring you guys, if we start working with you guys, we're going to see x number of revenue in terms of ROI. But I think what will happen is that we'll shorten our sales cycle or we'll improve our demo to trial stages and our sales funnel conversion rates, et cetera, which ultimately will lead up in revenue, but it just won't be directly linked to revenue, which is what they think. I guess one feedback from that director side is being able to sort of just clearly see their team's calls in their own glyphic account, almost cutting out the noise of the whole company. I think me and Callum spoke about this with you, Adam, didn't we? Sort of having that team breakdown. And so me and Callum can see everyone's calls, directors can only see their team's calls, and basically sales rep reps can see their calls and maybe their own team's calls if they want to. So kind of like breaking that up just because the call list gets obviously a bit noisy with engineering calls, product calls, sort of like those external ones that don't really quite matter to us. So, yeah, I think that would probably be the sort of main feedback point from the directors is just being able to have that clear visibility of what their team is doing. And at the moment they're using the cert, which does ticks the box for now. But I think it's just from an point of ease, that's the sort of feedback really helpful.\n\n<06:47> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nAnd I think adding that additional team filtering beyond my calls and all calls, I think that's definitely something we could discuss with the team and see how difficult it would be to add in there. Maybe a question here is, who do you think should be managing the team composition? Would it be you as the admin or you think it was Morgan? Actually, maybe not Morgan, but you, Callum, and someone else should be managing the team compositions.\n\n<07:18> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nOr would it be the sales directors in terms of who sits under what team, et cetera?\n\n<07:24> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nExactly.\n\n<07:27> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nThat would sit under me. I can work with that. And Jose is the sort of more of like the. Is more of like the IT admin guy, just in case of emergencies. He's got access from the legal standpoint and security standpoint, that's his role, just as that final backup. But I'll be the sort of main point of contact for this tool. So, yeah, the team competition would be me. Okay.\n\n<08:07> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nNo, that's great. Yeah, I guess last week we had that legal review, I think. I haven't heard from the council yet, but I was wondering if there's any kind of outstanding questions there. Also. Happy to pick it up when she's had time to review that.\n\n<08:27> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah. So pretty much give you a bit of information as to where we're currently at. So I haven't heard back from sush either. So what I can do, I can pop her an email just to sort of just double check, like. Right. Is there any other further legal questions or comments that you want to discuss? I'm currently just collating all feedback from the whole entire team and ultimately he's going to be building the business case and me and Callum will discuss on his return. So that's kind of where we're at at the moment. I've got a fair amount of feedback. I just need to make sure that I'm thorough and then we just have our standard business case process that we just have to go through.\n\n<09:25> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nSo what would be helpful from our side, I think, to input for the business case? Is there anything that you require?\n\n<09:38> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nSo, obviously, I assume Callum's requested a few things around, like costs, t's and et cetera, et cetera. So I assume that's just he can deal with that side from me. It's just making sure that ROI for the team. So that's the sort of part of the business case that I'm doing. So I guess if there's anything that you've got that could help me demonstrate the return of maybe other clients that have had or instances where they've seen real success of using the tool, I think that just helps me present it better. Okay. To the board or at least just position it in the correct way. But yeah, I think that would pretty much be it. It's just going through the classic box ticking exercise and the CEO is aware of this tool. So it's not product team also quite like it as well. So it's not just sales that are involved, which is helpful from our standpoint. But, yeah, you never really know until once you present and then it's one of those things where you can present it and it just gets shut down, or we present it and it all goes swimmingly. So it's one of those things. But I think feel like we're well armed to have a good conversation with the budget holder.\n\n<11:23> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nThat's great. Maybe one more question. There is so when we talked to Callum, with Callum a couple of weeks back, I think he asked for pricing for 30 seats. Currently, I think the number of active users. So people who connected their calendars are 1516. So should we still kind of go with pricing for 30 seats or do you kind of want to reconsider that on your end?\n\n<11:50> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nCould you give us two prices, one for 31? For 20 seats? Okay. Yeah. Because the 30 is our entire sales team. Plus probably, like our customer success and product. So at the moment, the issue is that I didn't want to keep shoving this product down people that weren't using it, and then we end up people just switching off and not liking the product just because I'm just being too aggressive from that side. I think obviously, if we did partner, then it would be a little bit more like. Right. This is more mandatory. We're now investing in with this product, this tool. Now you've got to start to use it. So we just needed to use a good testing ground and I think 1516 users was suffice.\n\n<12:44> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nOkay.\n\n<12:45> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nBut, yeah, no, that's great. Yeah, I guess this visibility on pricing on the 30 and the 20 would be great.\n\n<12:53> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nOkay. Yeah, definitely. And another question with the product team. Is that. So you might remember that earlier we discussed us being able to capture additional information from calls and I imagine that might be useful for the product team. As well. And we could potentially be aggregating this, I don't know, insights across calls. So it's something that we could also explore now or later on as well.\n\n<13:18> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah, I think at the moment where we see a gap is the feedback loop from clients into product. So I don't think there's two issues here. We have salespeople coming into product and just saying, passing comments of like our client said this, and then it's not tracked, it's not followed up, and it's lost. Or then we have the product team not really seeing any calls or getting visibility of what clients are saying. So I introduced it to Morgan, and he quite liked the chat GBT function of, hi, I'm a product manager. What should I take from this call type question in it? He quite liked that. And then obviously with the keyword search, I think that would help him out a lot. The only thing I would then sort of think about is how can we organize that? How can the team just easily view all calls that mention competitors, et cetera? So it's definitely something that we'd be interested in. I don't think we needed it quite now, but I think that would be like a big help. At the moment, we just have to manually submit it through the chatter function. On Salesforce, that's typically where we've just started doing that now, where we just provide feedback and add it to the chatter section on a call. So, yeah, that's where we sit in terms of the product feedback, but I think they would find it useful.\n\n<15:08> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nOkay. No, sounds great. Cool. No, I think, no. Great to hear that the team has been enjoying it. I can follow up on the pricing. I can follow up on any kind of case studies or any kind of supporting material that we can share for the business case. Yeah. And yeah, we'll look into the team filtering, team structure. It's something that I feel like should be possible, but, yeah, let me talk to the team and we can get back to you on that one.\n\n<15:43> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah, that would be great. I just think it just makes it cleaner. Right. And less chaotic for someone joining. That's where we'll see the value, when the directors can really just sort of see what their team doing. So, yeah, just making that less noisy for them, I think will just be a big help. But no, I mean, I appreciate all the help that you guys have done for us over the trial. Just sort of making the small incremental changes here and there has just obviously really made the trial process more effective. So, yeah, I appreciate the effort and yeah, I'll obviously keep you posted once I've spoken to Callum, and if you've got any questions or need anything from me, then I'm happy to help. Perfect.\n\n<16:31> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nYeah, maybe with Callum and timeline. So you mentioned he's away now. So are you catching up next week or when would you like to be building out the business case?\n\n<16:43> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nSo, yeah, I mean, I'm building out now, as we currently. Probably. He might be a little bit difficult to get hold of at the beginning of the week, just because of catching up post holiday. We can sort of look towards the end of next week, but I think that might just be a little bit of a moving target as we stand right now. And then maybe by the end of next week, I might have a bit more of an idea as to sort of timelines. But we'd like to. Obviously, if we do want to move forward, then we'd like to sort of move fairly quickly. We don't have to sort of dawdle around these sort of things, so might as well get it going if we want to proceed. Good.\n\n<17:28> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nNice and perfect. Cool.\n\n<17:32> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nGreat stuff. Well, yeah, much appreciated, guys. Always a pleasure speaking with you both. And, yeah, have a great week and let me know if you need anything. Yeah, thanks. Cheers, Adam. Cheers. Chat. Take care."

Yeah, nice.\n\n<02:27> Seller 2 (Chatura Fernando):\nAlso, there was one thing I spoke to Morgan as well, two weeks, a week ago, and he was talking about how the email generation wanted a bit of. A bit of improvement there and that's a little bit more early on, but we're thinking we might have some features there that will help him out. So hopefully that was ended.\n\n<02:44> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah, I did see that email from him. I do get it from his point of view in terms of maybe making it a little bit more AES, concise and sharp as possible, but I still think that maybe we shouldn't lean on that email generation follow up 100%. It should be almost like a framework that we can feed off and then he should make it his own email. But, yeah, I do get it. Maybe the bit more concise part of it, but no, I mean, it's good that he's looking into it. I think Morgan has probably been one of the guys that's the most engaged in the tool, which I probably would have put money on anyway, just because me and him are quite similar in the sense of the way how we sell. We like these kind of tools. We've used tools like this before, so it's kind of weird not having one, which is great. But I think, yeah, in terms of just the general feedback from. There was always going to be some people that don't engage with the tool. Not really a huge fan. It's typically normally the sales guys that probably maybe on the older side of the team that probably just quite happy just doing their own thing still. And then I think where we probably most likely find the benefit at the moment is in our regional account teams rather than our key accounts, just because the amount of calls are more frequent. So there's a lot more information to hold up. There's a lot more different accounts, a lot more different variety of usages, et cetera, et cetera. So that's where I think the team are finding it quite powerful and, yeah, so I've had two feedbacks from the two out of three feedbacks from the sales directors and I think they do find it useful. I don't think there's like a direct link they see a direct link to, like, if we bring you guys, if we start working with you guys, we're going to see x number of revenue in terms of ROI. But I think what will happen is that we'll shorten our sales cycle or we'll improve our demo to trial stages and our sales funnel conversion rates, et cetera, which ultimately will lead up in revenue, but it just won't be directly linked to revenue, which is what they think. I guess one feedback from that director side is being able to sort of just clearly see their team's calls in their own glyphic account, almost cutting out the noise of the whole company. I think me and Callum spoke about this with you, Adam, didn't we? Sort of having that team breakdown. And so me and Callum can see everyone's calls, directors can only see their team's calls, and basically sales rep reps can see their calls and maybe their own team's calls if they want to. So kind of like breaking that up just because the call list gets obviously a bit noisy with engineering calls, product calls, sort of like those external ones that don't really quite matter to us. So, yeah, I think that would probably be the sort of main feedback point from the directors is just being able to have that clear visibility of what their team is doing. And at the moment they're using the cert, which does ticks the box for now. But I think it's just from an point of ease, that's the sort of feedback really helpful.\n\n<06:47> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nAnd I think adding that additional team filtering beyond my calls and all calls, I think that's definitely something we could discuss with the team and see how difficult it would be to add in there. Maybe a question here is, who do you think should be managing the team composition? Would it be you as the admin or you think it was Morgan? Actually, maybe not Morgan, but you, Callum, and someone else should be managing the team compositions.\n\n<07:18> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nOr would it be the sales directors in terms of who sits under what team, et cetera?\n\n<07:24> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nExactly.\n\n<07:27> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nThat would sit under me. I can work with that. And Jose is the sort of more of like the. Is more of like the IT admin guy, just in case of emergencies. He's got access from the legal standpoint and security standpoint, that's his role, just as that final backup. But I'll be the sort of main point of contact for this tool. So, yeah, the team competition would be me. Okay.\n\n<08:07> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nNo, that's great. Yeah, I guess last week we had that legal review, I think. I haven't heard from the council yet, but I was wondering if there's any kind of outstanding questions there. Also. Happy to pick it up when she's had time to review that.\n\n<08:27> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah. So pretty much give you a bit of information as to where we're currently at. So I haven't heard back from sush either. So what I can do, I can pop her an email just to sort of just double check, like. Right. Is there any other further legal questions or comments that you want to discuss? I'm currently just collating all feedback from the whole entire team and ultimately he's going to be building the business case and me and Callum will discuss on his return. So that's kind of where we're at at the moment. I've got a fair amount of feedback. I just need to make sure that I'm thorough and then we just have our standard business case process that we just have to go through.\n\n<09:25> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nSo what would be helpful from our side, I think, to input for the business case? Is there anything that you require?\n\n<09:38> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nSo, obviously, I assume Callum's requested a few things around, like costs, t's and et cetera, et cetera. So I assume that's just he can deal with that side from me. It's just making sure that ROI for the team. So that's the sort of part of the business case that I'm doing. So I guess if there's anything that you've got that could help me demonstrate the return of maybe other clients that have had or instances where they've seen real success of using the tool, I think that just helps me present it better. Okay. To the board or at least just position it in the correct way. But yeah, I think that would pretty much be it. It's just going through the classic box ticking exercise and the CEO is aware of this tool. So it's not product team also quite like it as well. So it's not just sales that are involved, which is helpful from our standpoint. But, yeah, you never really know until once you present and then it's one of those things where you can present it and it just gets shut down, or we present it and it all goes swimmingly. So it's one of those things. But I think feel like we're well armed to have a good conversation with the budget holder.\n\n<11:23> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nThat's great. Maybe one more question. There is so when we talked to Callum, with Callum a couple of weeks back, I think he asked for pricing for 30 seats. Currently, I think the number of active users. So people who connected their calendars are 1516. So should we still kind of go with pricing for 30 seats or do you kind of want to reconsider that on your end?\n\n<11:50> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nCould you give us two prices, one for 31? For 20 seats? Okay. Yeah. Because the 30 is our entire sales team. Plus probably, like our customer success and product. So at the moment, the issue is that I didn't want to keep shoving this product down people that weren't using it, and then we end up people just switching off and not liking the product just because I'm just being too aggressive from that side. I think obviously, if we did partner, then it would be a little bit more like. Right. This is more mandatory. We're now investing in with this product, this tool. Now you've got to start to use it. So we just needed to use a good testing ground and I think 1516 users was suffice.\n\n<12:44> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nOkay.\n\n<12:45> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nBut, yeah, no, that's great. Yeah, I guess this visibility on pricing on the 30 and the 20 would be great.\n\n<12:53> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nOkay. Yeah, definitely. And another question with the product team. Is that. So you might remember that earlier we discussed us being able to capture additional information from calls and I imagine that might be useful for the product team. As well. And we could potentially be aggregating this, I don't know, insights across calls. So it's something that we could also explore now or later on as well.\n\n<13:18> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah, I think at the moment where we see a gap is the feedback loop from clients into product. So I don't think there's two issues here. We have salespeople coming into product and just saying, passing comments of like our client said this, and then it's not tracked, it's not followed up, and it's lost. Or then we have the product team not really seeing any calls or getting visibility of what clients are saying. So I introduced it to Morgan, and he quite liked the chat GBT function of, hi, I'm a product manager. What should I take from this call type question in it? He quite liked that. And then obviously with the keyword search, I think that would help him out a lot. The only thing I would then sort of think about is how can we organize that? How can the team just easily view all calls that mention competitors, et cetera? So it's definitely something that we'd be interested in. I don't think we needed it quite now, but I think that would be like a big help. At the moment, we just have to manually submit it through the chatter function. On Salesforce, that's typically where we've just started doing that now, where we just provide feedback and add it to the chatter section on a call. So, yeah, that's where we sit in terms of the product feedback, but I think they would find it useful.\n\n<15:08> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nOkay. No, sounds great. Cool. No, I think, no. Great to hear that the team has been enjoying it. I can follow up on the pricing. I can follow up on any kind of case studies or any kind of supporting material that we can share for the business case. Yeah. And yeah, we'll look into the team filtering, team structure. It's something that I feel like should be possible, but, yeah, let me talk to the team and we can get back to you on that one.\n\n<15:43> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah, that would be great. I just think it just makes it cleaner. Right. And less chaotic for someone joining. That's where we'll see the value, when the directors can really just sort of see what their team doing. So, yeah, just making that less noisy for them, I think will just be a big help. But no, I mean, I appreciate all the help that you guys have done for us over the trial. Just sort of making the small incremental changes here and there has just obviously really made the trial process more effective. So, yeah, I appreciate the effort and yeah, I'll obviously keep you posted once I've spoken to Callum, and if you've got any questions or need anything from me, then I'm happy to help. Perfect.\n\n<16:31> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nYeah, maybe with Callum and timeline. So you mentioned he's away now. So are you catching up next week or when would you like to be building out the business case?\n\n<16:43> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nSo, yeah, I mean, I'm building out now, as we currently. Probably. He might be a little bit difficult to get hold of at the beginning of the week, just because of catching up post holiday. We can sort of look towards the end of next week, but I think that might just be a little bit of a moving target as we stand right now. And then maybe by the end of next week, I might have a bit more of an idea as to sort of timelines. But we'd like to. Obviously, if we do want to move forward, then we'd like to sort of move fairly quickly. We don't have to sort of dawdle around these sort of things, so might as well get it going if we want to proceed. Good.\n\n<17:28> Seller 1 (Adam Liska):\nNice and perfect. Cool.\n\n<17:32> Buyer 0 (Alex Rivera):\nGreat stuff. Well, yeah, much appreciated, guys. Always a pleasure speaking with you both. And, yeah, have a great week and let me know if you need anything. Yeah, thanks. Cheers, Adam. Cheers. Chat. Take care."

How are you?\n\n<01:03> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nGood, thank you. I know we're still waiting on Callum, I believe that's right.\n\n<01:10> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nI think Alex maybe as well.\n\n<01:13> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nThat makes sense.\n\n<01:51> Buyer 4 (Alex Rivera):\nHi, Adam. Hey, sush. How ae you doing? Good, thank you.\n\n<01:55> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nHi.\n\n<01:58> Buyer 4 (Alex Rivera):\nYeah, all good, thank you. Good. How's the last week been, Adam? Whilst I was away? Anything from the guys?\n\n<02:10> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nI think nothing urgent, but I wanted to message you to maybe schedule a catch up also, the two of us. Yeah, maybe actually early next week, because I'll be off tomorrow and Friday, but I can message you on slack afterwards. Yeah, sure, yeah.\n\n<02:28> Buyer 4 (Alex Rivera):\nPop me a message and we can have a catch up when you're back. Yeah. Hey, Jordan.\n\n<02:41> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nHey, guys. Sorry, I'm always rubbish with zoom. I'll try and get my camera on. Hang on.\n\n<02:59> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nI know you guys do teams. It's the only one that we don't do normally on our side.\n\n<03:16> Buyer 4 (Alex Rivera):\nGreat. Yeah.\n\n<03:18> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nSo, I mean, Callum, this was, I think, from your end, you wanted to kind of go through the legal, I guess, implications and other stuff, I guess, around the legality and kind of, I guess, our practices et. Yeah.\n\n<03:36> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nOut of interest, Adam. Sorry, before we go there, out of interest, how do I remove this Freetrade notetaker from a zoom conversation?\n\n<03:44> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nSo there's three dots and then remove. But it has to be done by the host, so I can do it.\n\n<03:51> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nIt can only be done by the host. Yeah. Because in teams, anyone can do it, I think.\n\n<03:58> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nYeah, in teams, it depends on the settings of the team and I think we've gone through it and then basically you need to change something in the settings and then anyone on the team can do it in zoom. I believe it's just the host, but I could double check that. Yeah, please.\n\n<04:16> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nAnd could you remove the Freetrade notetaker, please?\n\n<04:22> Buyer 4 (Alex Rivera):\nThanks.\n\n<04:24> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nSo, sorry, I'm not sure if you and Sush had a chance to introduce before, but if not sush, why don't you go for Alex?\n\n<04:36> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nI'm the in house legal counsel here at Freetrade. I'm based in Massachusetts and Boston, USA, but I obviously work with the team across the globe, so relatively familiar with the issues that are faced from our team in Hong Kong versus UK versus the US. But it'll be good to sort of get more information on how we want to do this and sort of the concerns that there are. Perfect, yeah.\n\n<05:08> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nI'm Adam, CEO, co founder of Glyphic, based here in London.\n\n<05:16> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nIt's nice to meet you. Great, yeah.\n\n<05:21> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nSo I don't know whether you bant to go through it in a structured way or if you have kind of a list of questions already that you wanted to go through.\n\n<05:31> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nYeah, we can follow the structured manner. That way I won't miss anything by just looking at the questions I have. Perfect, yeah.\n\n<05:40> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nThen let's start with what's there. Sorry, do you have a list?\n\n<05:54> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nIt's very short. I figured I'll come up as we're talking, so I'll interject as needed.\n\n<06:00> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nOkay, cool. Callum, you're muted.\n\n<06:05> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nMaybe Adam, if you can start by giving us the general that you must have to have this conversation numerous times. Right. How do you approach this and what's the reality of the situation?\n\n<06:15> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nYeah, so I guess the coding laws, they differ kind of from country to country, state to state. But in most cases, I think it's quite. In most cases, basically if you get consent from all the participants on the call, I think in those cases you basically clear. I'm happy to share some documents around kind of call recording laws and overviews afterwards, but there's kind of either one party consent states, two party consent states in Europe most of the time. Well, basically everywhere in Europe you need to have consent from everyone on the call to record them. In the US it's state by state. Canada, Hong Kong, to be honest, I don't know. Canada, Australia, it's a two party consent as well. So from everyone on the call in terms of collecting the consent? It depends. Platform? Well, from platform to platform. So for example, in Zoom, I think you've gone through kind of the flow that's possible to implement in Zoom where you actually need to approve the recording. And then the participants, when they log in, they can kind of approve or not approve the recording. If they don't approve, then you can kick out the bot and then the call is not recorded.\n\n<07:35> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nIn teams, how do you know if they don't? We do know as the host.\n\n<07:41> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nYeah. So you will get a notification then I can share basically the flow and kind of what you see, I can share a doc afterwards, kind of what you see in the individual, but so in Zoom it's a bit easier. In Google Meet, in Google Meet and Microsoft Teams we don't have the opportunity to show the pop ups. So there what we can do, we can make announcements when anyone know this call is being recorded or this is recorded for the consent can be collected by the salesperson as kind of people join the call in order to get an active consent, which is again kind of the kind of safest option to do it other ways that it's possible to do it as well is to send, let's say, emails. We currently don't support that, but you can send an email before the meeting saying this call is being recorded, you can approve or not. We're not doing that. And sometimes it's also possible to add it on the invite, which is we don't have it implemented, but it's something that we could implement. But at the same time it's a passive consent, which in some states wouldn't be enough. You would still need to get that active consent.\n\n<09:03> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nSo in general, AE, you working with Microsoft to get the active consent in teams or is that not something that is going to come at some point, not working with them actively right now we can explore that.\n\n<09:22> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nWe haven't been exploring this direction with them yet.\n\n<09:25> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nHow did you do it with Zoom? Out of interest, was it just a straightforward process with Zoom?\n\n<09:29> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nWith Zoom, it was a straightforward process because they also kind of enabled this option for the call recording software. And so we just rolled it out to everyone because it's a cleaner process. But yeah, Microsoft Teams currently don't support that. We could definitely follow up with them, but I'm afraid that probably because they move a bit slow, it would probably not be something that would be possible to kind of get in in the next months.\n\n<09:58> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nIf there's a. Sorry. If there's verbal consent that's given oftentimes in the US, for example, in California where you need mutual consent, you can just do a verbal consent that this call is being recorded. Do you agree to the recording? Essentially, will the participant then have to do, or will they still be sent this sort of pop up to do the recording? Or basically, do we need to do it twice? Essentially? No.\n\n<10:31> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nSo with the pop up, with Zoom, so we know the pop up has been there. And so I think there, you know that the content's been collected on Microsoft Teams. Yeah. You need to collect that consent verbally. What we can do is actually automatically identify that this has been brought up. And so in glyphic we can kind of, let's say, have a tick that says consent has been collected or it's been announced that this call is recorded for notetaking purposes or something like that. That's something that we can do just to make sure we keep track of the consent being collected.\n\n<11:15> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nThank you. And then the consent that's being collected, will we get sort of a live report of who has consented and who hasn't? Or is it sort of at the end of the call so that we can address the current. Yeah.\n\n<11:30> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nSo if we were to kind of automatically identifying it, whether it's been collected, then in glyphic, you would see it as AES. No, the content was collected and then we could export a report saying it's been collected on 80% of calls. Maybe these users don't collect it. We can collect it on. Maybe we need to work with them or remind them or something like that. That's possible.\n\n<11:55> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nAnd sorry, one more question. If this is a recurring meeting, is there a system to sort of have the client consent, sort of do a blanket consent as necessary for all the recurring events?\n\n<12:11> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nSo in Zoom, you would still get the consent every time. In Microsoft Teams, if we're identifying of when we, when we implemented, it was always kind of on a per call basis. On the first call we could actually identify whether you collected the content for all the future meetings. I'm just afraid that in case there's, let's say, new participants in one of the follow up meetings, that maybe added one off. It's probably always better to kind of mention it every single time.\n\n<12:44> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nOkay, thank you.\n\n<12:48> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nAdam, have you got a copy of your kind of master or General T's and C's that you're able to send over to us to start having a look at?\n\n<12:56> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nYeah, so I can send over T's and C's. The data processing agreement also. So we are stuck to type one compliant. So in terms of kind of data storage, the security, I can send documentation around that as well. And then that kind of covers the information around the ownership of the data. If the account is canceled, that within 30 days, we'll basically delete all data that's related to your account. And then actually with some european customers for them, we would also fill out their data. Let me see how it's called. Data protection impact assessment document, in which they were trying to identify from a GDPR perspective whether there's any impact around collecting personal data. And in those cases, it was usually a low risk just because we're not building any kind of person specific models identifying, let's say, people from their voice or anything like that. We were basically just transcribing the call and then extracting information that's related to the sales process. In those cases, it was low impact when we went through the GDPR review, but I can share that as well.\n\n<14:26> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nShare the t's and C's. Could you also share the language that's used in the pop up bubble, essentially, so that I can take a closer look at that as well?\n\n<14:35> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nYeah, definitely.\n\n<14:37> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nThank you.\n\n<14:44> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nGreat any other questions?\n\n<14:54> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nNot this time, but when you share the t's and Ces, I'll take a closer look at the Hong Kong regulations as well, just to make sure we're covered on that end. And then if there's any red flags, I can let you know. Perfect.\n\n<15:06> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nYeah, no, happy to kind of review and see and any kind of red lines you would have on the tsncs. Also happy to review afterwards.\n\n<15:13> Buyer 3 (Morgan Blake):\nGreat. Thank you. Perfect. Jordan, anything else from perfect?\n\n<15:22> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nYeah, no, thanks. I'll follow up later today. And then, Alex, Jordan, happy to also catch up separately, kind of in general, how it's been going and any other feedback and maybe some updates on some of the features that we were discussing last time as well.\n\n<15:37> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nOkay, sounds good. To be perfectly honest, I haven't really spent much time on this for the last couple of weeks, but happy to. I'm sure. We need to start doing so. Perfect. Thank you. Great.\n\n<15:51> Buyer 4 (Alex Rivera):\nCool. Thanks, Helen.\n\n<15:52> Buyer 0 (Jordan Hayes):\nThanks.\n\n<15:53> Seller 2 (Adam Liska):\nThank you all."
